# BRIN for SQLite (Experimental)

This project is an experimental fork of **SQLite** that aims to implement a **Block Range Index (BRIN)** inside SQLite.  
BRIN indexes are compact, range-based indexes designed to handle **large ordered datasets** such as time series, logs, and IoT data.  
They are already available in PostgreSQL, but SQLite currently lacks this feature.  

This repository is part of a **research project at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Guadalajara** for a Master's thesis in Computer Science.
